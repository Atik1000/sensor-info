                        Canopy reflectance sensors are useful tools for guiding
                        nitrogen fertilization in crops. However, studies of
                        sugarcane comparing the efficiency of different devices
                        for determining crop parameters are scarce. The
                        objective of this study was to compare the performance
                        of canopy sensors in detecting sugarcane variability.
                        Four nitrogen (N) rate experiments were conducted
                        (plots), along with biomass sampling, chlorophyll meter
                        readings and leaf N concentration determination in
                        another four fields by canopy sensor readings guided
                        samplings.

                        The OptRx also uses the reflectance of light on the
                        growing plants to measure real-time crop health. This
                        data is further processed to determine the vegetative
                        index of the crop. The readings obtained are used to set
                        aside crops with a high vegetative index to the rest of
                        the crops. This comparison is done by 2 algorithms â€“
                        NDVI (for small crops) & NDVE (for large and late growth
                        of crops)
